```thinking
Code covers external libs, folders, files, functions, classes, methods, variables; but missing export handling, arrow functions, interface/type constructs, and function parameter nodes --> export statements (module boundary), arrow functions as first-class entities, TypeScript-specific types/interfaces, and parameters are not mapped & could enhance the semantic graph
```

You're off to a strong start, but here are some critical points you might be missing:

1. **Export Declarations:**  
   Your script captures imports well but doesn't handle export statements (both named and default). Mapping these would help link internal definitions to the module’s public API.

2. **Arrow Functions:**  
   Arrow function expressions (often used in modern JS/TS) are not explicitly handled. Consider detecting and mapping them as functions, especially if they’re assigned to variables.

3. **TypeScript Constructs:**  
   Since you assume TypeScript, you might want to capture interfaces, type aliases, enums, and even class property types. These add another semantic layer to your graph.

4. **Function Parameters:**  
   Capturing parameters as nodes or as metadata can provide deeper insights into function signatures and usages.

5. **Object Method Properties:**  
   Methods defined on object literals (not within classes) are common. Including them can help you cover more of the code’s architecture.

Overall, you're generally there for a static map. Tighten up these areas, and your design will offer a richer, more comprehensive view of the codebase.
